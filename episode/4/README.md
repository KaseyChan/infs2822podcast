Laying down firm foundations using the Module 1 Exit Survey:
- Code samples now available as requested

- Only takes about 3 minutes!

Laying down firm foundations in the Midterm:

### What to do before Week 5

- Week 5 "reading" (see Field Manual - only 12 minutes of YouTube videos!)

- Midterm Task: 5 minutes of footage (probably will take an hour or two)
- Don't forget to respond to the Module 1 exit survey!

Keep up the great work ðŸ˜Ž
