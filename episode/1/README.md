### Recap of Week 1

- Unix-based shell
- Command line interface: precision in and out (`ls`, `date`, flags, etc.)
- [shellstarterkit](https://github.com/blairw/shellstarterkit) installation
- Pacing out the content: let's all take a deep breath
- As the lecturer, it's easy for me to take things for granted: please let me know if I've glossed over something! (Please post to [INFS2822 Ed](https://edstem.org/courses/4444/discussion/))
- I was inspired by students helping each other, so...

### Looking forward to Week 2

- New buddy system! (Ed [#296565](https://edstem.org/courses/4444/discussion/296565))
    - Group Assignment document updated
    - Documents could be updated - I will let you know via Ed - but you can always check your files' revision numbers / published date
- Deep dive into Python using [Python Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)

### What to do before Week 2

- Find a buddy (if you would like - otherwise I will allocate for you)
- Tasks in Tutorial "definition of done" slide
- Reading for next week: see the Field Manual on Moodle.

See you in class next Monday! ðŸ˜Ž

&mdash; Blair.
