Wrapping up Python Software Carpentry:
- Handling errors/exceptions
- Quality Assurance (QA)

Programming "for" Data Analytics (software development with analytics in mind):
- Hardware: e.g. Raspberry Pi with sensor modules for data collection using `cron`
- Software: App Analytics - generally for improving user experience / understanding user journeys (e.g. Sankey Diagram)

Guest Lecture/Interview (Nara So):
- Research shows that diversity in teams leads to better outcomes
- Communicating with awareness of who you are communicating with
