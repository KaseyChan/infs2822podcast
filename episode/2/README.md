_This week, we deep-dived into the Python language. Much of what we learnt could be summarised with that old saying/meme: Adapt, Improvise, Overcome._

### Recap of Week 2

Adapt
- `pandas` and `pandasql` built on top of `numpy`
- `seaborn` built on top of `matplotlib`
- We are all standing on the shoulders of giants!

Improvise
- Data analytics in Python is a little bit more ad-hoc than building apps/programs
- The language and libraries are a bit more ad-hoc: loose tying, lightweight libraries
- Writing code for data cleansing when you encounter issues

Overcome
- Overcoming common mistakes: forgetting the `venv`, using semicolons, stuffing up the indentation...
- Matthew and I deliberately do live code demos so you can see us making - and overcoming - human mistakes :)
- Writing Python for data analytics is almost like overcoming shortcomings in packaged software

### What to do before Week 3

- Stay up to date with your coding (incl. tutorial work)
- Stay in touch with your tutorial buddy
- "Reading" for Week 3: GitHub video

See you in class next Monday! ðŸ˜Ž

&mdash; Blair.
